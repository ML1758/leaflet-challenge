Leaflet Assignment - Milinda 'ML' Liyanage

## Summary

* This assignment is to use leaflet to create an interactive map.
* The assignment is in two steps; the second step builds upon step 1.
* The first step is to display a basic map with a popup.
* The second step is to display the map with a second data set and display multiple layers.

### The following tasks were done for Step 1: 

* The data, which was in json format, was read from USGS website using D3. 
* A function was created to display the basic layer. Used the light map for this layer.
* A function was created to define the colours for the depth range.
* The circleâ€™s radius was used to define the magnitude. The value was multiplied by 5 to get a reasonable size circle.
* Using the colours, the legend was added to the map.
* The style sheet was updated to include the legend's formatting.

### Optional Step 2:

* Copied the entire Level 1 folder structure in to a new folder structure, called Leaflet-Step-2. 
* Two additional base map layers were added, i.e., Satellite & Outdoors.
* One overlay map was added with the earthquake data.
* A controller was added to switch the base layer maps and the overlay map.

* Reading and displaying the second set of data was not attempted.
